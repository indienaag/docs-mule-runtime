You migrate your existing Mule 3 applications that are managed by API Manager to Mule 4 using the following steps: 

. <<prepare-migration,Prepare for your migration>>
+
Based on how your existing Mule 3 application is configured, carefully review the prerequisites to prepare for your migration.
. <<determine-migration-approach,Determine your migration approach>>
+
Based on several factors, such as whether the migration requires taking downtime, removing applied policies, migrating contracts, creating an instance for the migration.
. <<perform-migration,Perform the migration>>
+
Migrate your application.


[[prepare-migration]]
== Prepare to Migrate Your Mule 3 Applications

Before you migrate your existing API-managed Mule 3 applications to Mule 4, carefully review the following guidelines and determine:

* How your Mule 3 application is managed: basic endpoint, integration application, or complex proxy
+
To migrate your application in this scenario, first xref:mule-runtime::migration-api-gateways.adoc[review how to migrate API gateways]
to prepare, and then xref:mule-runtime::migration-intro.adoc[migrate to Mule 4].
* How your application is secured: default or custom policies
+
If you applied custom policies to your Mule 3 API, follow xref:mule-runtime::migration-api-gateways-policies.adoc[Migrating API Policies]. If you have applied an out-of-the-box proxy, you can recreate the proxy by using the API Manager UI.
* Whether you have classified your API
+
If you have not classified your API, first xref:api-manager::classify-api-task.adoc[classify an API Instance into an Environment].


[[determine-migration-approach]]
== Determine Your Migration Approach

You migrate your API Manager-managed Mule 3 application by creating an instance. Before migrating to Mule 4, carefully consider the following factors to determine the approach that best suits your requirements:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Migration Factor | Create API Instance
| Requires downtime | No 
| Requires removing applied policies | No
| Requires migrating contracts | Yes
| Provides API metrics continuity on API Instance | No
|===


[[perform-migration]]
== Perform the Migration

You can migrate your Mule 3 application using:

* <<migrate-with-new-api,A New API Instance>>

[[migrate-with-new-api]]
=== Migrate Using a New API Instance

Use the high-level proposal illustrated in the following diagram to use a new API instance for configuring an independent Mule runtime instance on Mule 4:

image:new-instance-migration-mule4.png[]

If your Mule application is not a proxy, this same proposal applies to your migration procedure, without the backend component.

To migrate your Mule 3 API to Mule 4 using a new API instance: 

. From the *API Administration* page in API Manager, select *Manage API* > *Create new API*. 
+
Use an instance label to identify this new API instance. 
. On the *Endpoint Configuration* window, select `Mule 4` in *Mule version* and save.
. From the left navigation pane in API Manager, apply alerts, SLA tiers, and policies to your API.
. If your API uses contract-based policies, for example Client ID Enforcement policy, <<migrate-contracts,migrate the contracts>> of the API instance. 
. If you completed configuring your API, start your Mule 4 application and try sending it requests. 
. After successfully validating your application, undeploy your Mule 3 application.


[[migrate-contracts]]
=== Migrate Contracts

Before migrating your application by creating a new API instance, migrate existing API contracts to your new Mule 4 environment. 

*Task Prerequisite*

Before you migrate your contracts, ensure that you have the following roles:

* Organization Administrator of the root organization
* Application Owner of every application that has a contract with the source API

To migrate contracts using the Anypoint Platform UI:

.. Go to *API Manager* > *Client Applications* and select the application.
+
Ensure that the `API` option is selected in the *Contracts* field.
.. On the right navigation, scroll down to the *Owners* field and add your name.
.. From *Exchange*, select your API instance and request access. 
.. From *API Manager*, grant yourself the access. 


To automate the request approval process:

. Add owners for the application:

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
  --data-raw '{}' 
----


== Migrating to the Latest Mule 3 Version

If you are not ready to migrate to Mule 4 and you need to migrate to the latest version of Mule 3, see xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/updating-mule-versions.adoc[Upgrading Mule Runtime Engine(Versions 3.x to 3.n)].

Carefully review the release notes for the Mule version to which you are migrating. When you start the new Mule runtime with the same application pointing to the same API instance, your existent API is instantly managed with the latest Mule 3.x version. You do not need to perform any additional steps in API Manager.
